## **¡¡Hello World...!!**

```text
It is a pleasure to greet you. Let me tell you a little about myself.
Throughout my professional career, life has given me the opportunity
to explore different paths, but what I am passionate about is the world
of programming. Currently, I work on freelance projects to maintain
and improve my technical skills, and through this repository,
I share my progress in this exciting journey of programming.

Thank you for visiting my profile. Here you will find a variety of projects
I have worked on, each representing a step towards perfecting my skills
as a programmer. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if
you have any questions or suggestions. I hope you find inspiration or
usefulness in my work for your own journey in the world of programming.

More about me 👨‍💻--> Outside of programming, something interesting to say is that
I have played soccer since my childhood and it is a taste that I still have,
I also adopted a taste for carpentry, creating and giving physical shape to something
you imagine is very satisfying for me. Socially, I like to spend time with
my loved ones, whether traveling, eating, or watching a movie.
